* Identicon

Identicon generator example in Elixir

- Identicon :: An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value, usually of an IP address, that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users' privacy. The original Identicon was a 9-block graphic, and the representation has been extended to other graphic forms by third parties.


* How it works

Let's say there is one string input such as username.


#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  def main(input) do
    input
    |> hash_input
    |> pick_color
    |> build_grid
    |> filter_odd_squares
    |> build_pixel_map
    |> draw_image
    |> save_image(input)
  end
#+END_SRC
